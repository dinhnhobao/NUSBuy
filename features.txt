Feedback from Milestone 1:

i) Conversations between buyers and sellers. How to store this?***
ii) why website/mobile app?
iii) Scalability
iv) Data security
iv) Payment gateway: Singtel Dash or DBSPaylah.
For Payment Gateway, would this introduce a new e-money wallet? 
Would it be more troublesome for users to manage them? 
--->Would it be easier if users paid 
each other on the spot using existing apps like Paylah or PayNow? <---

v)
make video quality better as it is quite blurry. 

vi) OpenID** ** **
vii)Maps

You guys will have to make it more appealing, more features 
and give reasons why NUS students will prefer your app over Carousel.


1) Share a product listing on social media platforms
2) Ratings feature 
---------------------------------------------
authentication has to be re-setup on production
bugs:
    requiring https when I only have http (Facebook Login API)
    user, avatar, email
-----------------------------------------------
Must obtain new google authentication key on production
authorisation callback URLs is different for each website, 
some website has strict restrictions (e.g. facebook https only, localhost cannot, etc.)

***The redirect_url specifies where we redirect users after 
they have chosen whether or not to authenticate your application.
Feedback from Milestone 2:

(assigned) UI
(bug +)
hard-coding Google Maps

(bug +)
views can be manipulated unless you have a way to prevent that (needs clarification)
whilst price could compliment the search function so you can sort by prices for a particular product 
(since price alone would be useless if there are different products).

(testing) "You can find friends to test out your apps and compare with Carousell.
It can help you to figure out what's missing or what's not needed in your application.
Some things users can feedback on is whether the entire use process 
is streamlined, convenient, and pain points. PRODUCT DATABASE TEST: stress test the system + reveal any bugs

(bug +)
Facebook Authentication doesn't work on localhost, but should work on production. We will implement it on production (for Facebook only), the other platforms we will show only on the video.
(feature +)Payment feature is FAIRLY necessary. 
(feature) OpenID is not possible
"The feature is adequately specified for the final phase, 
and the features mentioned would be good implementation for NUSBuy. 
Rating features , profile page and social media integration 
help to check credibility, and the implementation of QR code payment 
would make it easy for users to purchase the items from the seller.
"
(feature +) what attributes do we take from API apart from name
